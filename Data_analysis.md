For "The Substance", which is our main movie, has shown a high number of reviews and actor insights reflect a strong focus on the reception and the cast's personal perspectives. Streaming information is also a significant topic, indicating interest in how audiences can access the movie through online platform.

"Alien Romulus" shows a high volume of upcoming movie announcements of its sequel, reflecting perhaps significant anticipation or promotional efforts. Streaming and reviews are also strongly represented, suggesting interest in how to watch and audience reception.

For "Smile 2", most articles here focus on streaming information, signaling strong viewer interest. Reviews are moderately represented, while behind-the-scenes and actor insights articles are fewer, reflecting perhaps less media coverage or promotional focus.

For "Venom 3", there were a pack of Box-office articles which suggest financial performance and viewer turnout are key topics. The lack of streaming and behind-the-scenes articles indicates limited media coverage on those aspects.

"Speak No Evil" has a heavy skew towards streaming information, with very few reviews and no coverage in other categories. This suggests very limited coverage overall.
